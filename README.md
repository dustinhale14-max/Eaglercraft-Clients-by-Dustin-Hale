# Eaglercraft-Clients-by-Dustin-Hale
This repository is a (in)complete Eaglercraft file collection made by me. All of these files work offline. Eaglercraft is a open-source Minecraft client that runs entirely in a web browser using JavaScript. It allows users to play Minecraft, without needing to download a separate client.
